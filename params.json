Modern gateway systems are moving towards microservice architectures and DevOps principles such as containerization (Docker), continuous integration and continuous delivery.  Many gateways are also investigating how to integrate Apache’s “big data” and cloud computing software projects like Apache Mesos, Apache Spark, Apache Samza, Apache JClouds and Apache Kafka. RPC versus message-oriented middleware at scale is also an open question, as are NoSQL versus Relational DB approaches for gateway data management.  Finally, as gateways typically include Web-based user environments, choosing the right technologies and crafting the correct user experience are challenging problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this course, students will be divided into development teams, and each team will build a science gateway software as a service system from scratch. Teams will be encouraged to explore alternative technologies and ways for building science gateways as well as learning DevOps principles for deploying robust cloud services.  Students will also be introduced to the Apache Software Foundation’s open community governance principles for open source software and will learn how to effectively interact with Apache Software Foundation projects in order to become committers and project management committee members.\r\n\r\n### Instructors\r\nThe course will be taught by Marlon Pierce and Suresh Marru, who lead the IU Science Gateway Group and are project management committee members for the Apache Airavata open source software.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nStudents should be familiar with Linux and Unix operating systems, basic networking concepts, one or more programming languages, databases, basics of Web development, and version control systems\r\n\r\n\r\n## Course Outline\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Assignments\r\n\r\nPoints for each assignment are awarded for the number of required capabilities that can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n1. Assignment. Write clients that can submit and monitor jobs to BR2, Karst, and Amazon/Quarry/Jetstream.\r\n\r\n2. Assignment: Develop initial services\r\n\r\n3. Assignment: Continuous integration and deployment\r\n\r\n4. Assignment : Determine and implement metadata management system\r\n\r\n5. Assignment: Integration, end-to-end testing\r\n\r\n6. Assignment: Throttling and scheduling\r\n\r\n7. Assignment: Scaling, load balancing and fault tolerance\r\n\r\n8. Assignment: Workflows\r\n\r\n\r\n## Student Teams\r\n\r\n* Team size will depend on enrollment but will range from 2-5.\r\n* Agree on an editor and environment that the team is comfortable with. We recommend IntelliJ Idea\r\n* Team members who are less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time\r\n* Switch who's \"driving\" regularly\r\n* Make sure to save the code and send it to all team members.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Beginner Materials\r\n\r\nThis class assumes you are confident with this material, but in case you need a brush-up...\r\n\r\n* Distributed Systems – [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) and [jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery)\r\n* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) by Marijn Haverbeke, Chapters 1-5\r\n* [Want to learn JavaScript in 2015?](https://medium.com/@_cmdv_/i-want-to-learn-javascript-in-2015-e96cd85ad225)\r\n* see also – [Other Lists](#other-lists)\r\n\r\n### Recommended Reading\r\n\r\n* [Overview of Apache Airavata](link)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n* code validation: [JSLint](http://jslint.com) / [JSHint](http://jshint.com)\r\n* debugging:\r\n    * [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/index)\r\n        * [Official debugging tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tut_debugging)\r\n        * Tutorial: [JavaScript Diagnosis](http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/10/javascript-diagnosis.html)\r\n    * [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)\r\n* sharing code snippets: [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)\r\n* asking questions: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)\r\n\r\n#### GitHub\r\n\r\n* Git and GitHub\r\n    * [Official GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/)\r\n    * [Recommended resources](http://hackerhours.org/resources.html#github)\r\n* GitHub Pages\r\n    * [Official site](https://pages.github.com/)\r\n    * [Thinkful guide](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Grading\r\n\r\n* Grades are based on points that each team acquires through submitting assignments, mid-term and final presentations, and peer reviewing other teams’ codes.\r\n\r\n\t* Students who show little activity on GitHub may not receive their team’s points.\r\n\r\n* Other bonus opportunities will be available.\r\n\r\n\t* If a team adopts a component from another team, both the adopting team and the donating team will receive bonus points. This can be done 1 time per team per semester.\r\n\r\n\t* Teams that contribute successful pull requests to other teams for bug fixes will be rewarded, as will the team that accepts the pull requests. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Open Collaboration\r\n\r\nReuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. We won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.\r\n\r\nPlease respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledement \r\nThe github repository structure, website and sysllabus are forked from https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus.

* Assignments due every two weeks. 
* All assignments are individual assignments.
* The course will be split into two parts
    * Part 1: Learning basic distributed computing concepts, microservices, DevOps etc
    * Part 2: Applying what you have learned to Apache Airavata 


## Instructors
The course will be taught by Marlon Pierce and Suresh Marru, who lead the Pervasive Technology Institute's [Science Gateways Research Center](https://sgrc.iu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and are project management committee members for the Apache Airavata open source software.

## Open Collaboration

* Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. We won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

* Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate a design or code from elsewhere, credit the original source.

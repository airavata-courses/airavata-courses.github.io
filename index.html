                    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                    <p>Distributed software systems use software components operating on multiple, coordinated computing
                        resources to handle large amounts of data, provide resilience by removing single points of
                        failure, and achieve better performance than single-component systems. Such systems form the
                        backbone of enormously scalable cloud-based software systems that power social networks,
                        e-commerce, streaming media services, and many others; however, many of the core concepts for
                        distributed systems that underlie the modern services go back decades and need to be understood
                        in order to build new systems.</p>
                    <p>Inherently, distributed systems face challenges that can be categorized as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Scalability: How well does the system scale as it adds more resources? What are the
                            overheads for management and coordination as the system grows?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Efficiency: System handles large amount of data, so performance is important
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fault tolerance: Can the system continue to operate if some of the components fail? Can the
                            system recover full capacity when resources come back online?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Communications: How do the components of the system communicate? How well does the system
                            handle message latency and loss?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Heterogeneity: How can a system be built out of components developed using multiple
                            programming languages, supporting components (such as databases), etc?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Integration, Deployment, and Operation: How can multi-component systems developed by
                            multiple teams be integrated, tested, deployed into production, and operated at scale?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User Environments: How can user environments be developed at scale? How can they efficiently
                            evolve as the underlying system evolves?
                        </li>
                        <li>Security: how can these systems be operated securely? How can security problems be
                            detected?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As an applied course, the students will get an opportunity to work with concrete instances of
                        distributed systems. Science gateways are distributed computing environments that enable
                        scientists to conduct computational experiments on computing clouds and supercomputers and have
                        revolutionized bioinformatics, computational chemistry, nano-engineering, atmospheric science
                        and other scientific fields by bringing unprecedented computing power to a broad community of
                        scientists. Gateways are interesting topics in their own right. Modern gateway systems utilize
                        microservice architectures and DevOps principles in their design and operations, adopting
                        lessons learned from cloud-based Software as a Service activities.

                        In this course, students will be divided into development teams, and each team will build a
                        distributed system software as a service system from scratch. Teams will be encouraged to
                        explore alternative technologies and ways for building systems as well as learning DevOps
                        principles such as containerization, continuous integration, and continuous deployment for
                        deploying robust cloud services. Students will also be introduced to the Apache Software
                        Foundation’s open community governance principles for open source software and will learn how to
                        effectively interact with Apache Software Foundation projects in order to become committers and
                        project management committee members. Finally, the students will have an opportunity to apply
                        the learning to Apache Airavata based Science Gateways.</p>

                                <li>Part 1: Learning basic cloud native architectures, distributed computing concepts,

                    <h2>Grading</h2>
                    <p>This will be a project heavy course. Students will be divided into teams. Each team will have 3
                        projects. There will also be a midterm and final presentation. The maximum number of points for
                        the semester is 100. 90-100 points is an A, 80-89 points is a B, etc.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Course Projects 90%: There will be 3 projects, including mid-term and final milestones. Each
                            project is worth 25 points.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Must use Apache compatible open source licensed software and tools</li>
                                <li>Projects must be checked into github, must be reproducibly executable on the
                                    deadline day by the AI’s and instructors.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Linux/Unix compatible</li>
                                        <li>If the instructors cannot execute your project and verify you have met the
                                            success criteria, the team receives 0 points.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>A team may resubmit their assignment at any time before the next milestone.
                                            Each resubmission gets -1 points; i.e., 9 points if you get it right on the
                                            second try, 8 points on the third try, etc.

                                <li>Students who show no activity (no github commits, no email discussions, etc) for the
                                    milestone will receive 0 points.
                                </li>
                                <li>Up to 5 points for GitHub interactions with other projects (not your team’s
                                    project). Examples include
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Posting bugs that get resolved</li>
                                        <li>Resolving bugs in other team’s projects. These must be accepted to the code
                                            base. Trivial issues don’t get rewarded.
                                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Classroom Interactions and Peer Reviews: 10%. The projects and the topics will require
                            interactive pro-active participation. Also mimicking real-world open source and software
                            development practices, the course requires students to be aware of other approaches to
                            problems, borrowing ideas (with proper acknowledgements and no stealing and plagiarizing)
                            and peer reviewing and offering constructive feedback. These demonstrated interactions (on
                            github issues and pull requests) will be worth 10 points.
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 point perfect attendance</li>

                                <li>Each project will be judged on ~4 quality attributes. The number will vary by
                                    assignment
                                </li>
                                <li>To get all points, the project must demonstrate all attributes to the grader. The
                                    grader must also be able to easily install and test all software by following
                                    documentation for the milestone in the team’s GitHub Wiki.
                                </li>
                                <li>Each student on the team will submit a report describing what they did

                    <p>During the course, instructors will provide references to journal and conference papers. A good
                        understanding of concepts discussed in these referred papers will greatly help in absorbing the

                            Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development. As a
                            professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch. This class is structured
                            such that all solutions are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.
                            We won’t hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without
                            challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.
